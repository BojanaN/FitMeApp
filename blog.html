                    </div>
                    <div class="blog-box">
                        <img src="images/first-article.jpg">
                        <p>"Not all calories are created equal.
                            Different foods go through different metabolic pathways in your body.
                            They can have vastly different effects on your hunger, hormones and the number of calories you burn.
                            Here are the 20 most weight-loss-friendly foods on earth that are supported by science. </p>
                            
                            <p><b>1. Whole Eggs</b></p>
                            Once feared for being high in cholesterol, whole eggs have been making a comeback.
                            Although a high intake of eggs raises the levels of “bad” LDL-cholesterol in some people, they are one of the best foods to eat if you need to lose weight. They are high in protein and fat, and are very satiating. One study in 30 overweight women showed that eating eggs for breakfast, instead of bagels, increased feelings of fullness (satiety) and made participants eat less for the next 36 hourс.
                            Another eight-week study found that eggs for breakfast increased weight loss on a calorie restricted diet, compared to bagels.
                            Eggs are also incredibly nutrient dense and can help you get all the nutrients you need on a calorie-restricted diet. Interestingly, almost all the nutrients are found in the yolks.
                            <p><b>SUMMARY &nbsp</b> Eggs are very filling and nutrient-dense. Compared to refined carbs like bagels, eggs can suppress appetite later in the day and may even promote weight loss.</p>
                            <p><b>2. Leafy Greens</b></p>
                            Leafy greens include kale, spinach, collards, swiss chards and a few others.
                            They have several properties that make them perfect for a weight loss diet, such as being low in calories and carbohydrates and loaded with fiber.
                            Eating leafy greens is a great way to increase the volume of your meals, without increasing the calories. Numerous studies show that meals and diets with a low energy density make people eat fewer calories overall. Leafy greens are also incredibly nutritious and very high in many vitamins, antioxidants and minerals, including calcium, which has been shown to aid fat burning in some studies.
                            <p><b>SUMMARY &nbsp</b>Leafy greens are an excellent addition to your weight loss diet. Not only are they low in calories but also high in fiber that helps keep you feeling full.</p>
                            <p><b>3. Salmon</b></p>
                            Fatty fish like salmon is incredibly healthy and very satisfying, keeping you full for many hours with relatively few calories.
                            Salmon is loaded with high-quality protein, healthy fats and various important nutrients.
                            Fish — and seafood in general — may also supply a significant amount of iodine.
                            This nutrient is necessary for proper thyroid function, which is important to keep your metabolism running optimally.
                            Studies show that a significant number of people don’t fill their iodine needs. Salmon is also loaded with omega-3 fatty acids, which have been shown to help reduce inflammation, which is known to play a major role in obesity and metabolic disease.
                            Mackerel, trout, sardines, herring and other types of fatty fish are also excellent.
                            <p><b>SUMMARY &nbsp </b> Salmon is high in both protein and omega-3 fatty acids, making it a good choice for a healthy weight loss diet.</p>
                            <p><b>4. Cruciferous Vegetables</b></p>
                            Cruciferous vegetables include broccoli, cauliflower, cabbage and Brussels sprouts.
                            Like other vegetables, they’re high in fiber and tend to be incredibly filling.
                            What's more, these types of veggies generally contain decent amounts of protein.
                            They're not nearly as high in protein as animal foods or legumes but still high compared to most vegetables.
                            A combination of protein, fiber and low energy density makes cruciferous vegetables the perfect foods to include in your meals if you need to lose weight.
                            They’re also highly nutritious and contain cancer-fighting substances.
                            <p><b>SUMMARY &nbsp</b>Cruciferous vegetables are low in calories but high in fiber and nutrients. Adding them to your diet is not only an excellent weight loss strategy but may also improve your overall health.</p>
                            <p><b>5. Lean Beef and Chicken Breast</b></p>
                            Meat has been unfairly demonized.
                            It has been blamed for various health problems despite a lack of good evidence to back up these negative claims.
                            Though processed meat is unhealthy, studies show that unprocessed red meat does not raise the risk of heart disease or diabetes. According to two big review studies, red meat has only a very weak correlation with cancer in men and no correlation at all in women.
                            The truth is, meat is a weight-loss-friendly food because it's high in protein.
                            Protein is by far the most filling nutrient, and eating a high-protein diet can make you burn up to 80–100 more calories per day. Studies have shown that increasing your protein intake to 25–% of daily calories can cut cravings by 60%, reduce your desire for late-night snacking by half and cause weight loss of almost one pound (0.45 kg) per week.
                            If you're on a low-carb diet, feel free to eat fatty meats. However, if you're on a moderate- to high-carbohydrate diet, choosing lean meats may be more appropriate.
                            <p><b>SUMMARY &nbsp</b>Eating unprocessed lean meat is an excellent way to increase your protein intake. Replacing some of the carbs or fat in your diet with protein could make it easier for you to lose excess fat. </p>
                            <p><b>6. Boiled Potatoes</b></p>
                            White potatoes seem to have fallen out of favor for some reason.
                            However, they have several properties that make them a perfect food — both for weight loss and optimal health.
                            They contain an incredibly diverse range of nutrients — a little bit of almost everything you need.
                            There have even been accounts of people living on nothing but potatoes alone for extended periods of time.
                            They’re particularly high in potassium, a nutrient that most people don't get enough of and that plays an important role in blood pressure control.
                            On a scale called the Satiety Index, which measures how filling different foods are, white, boiled potatoes scored the highest of all the foods tested. 
                            What this means is that by eating white, boiled potatoes, you will naturally feel full and eat less of other foods.
                            If you allow potatoes to cool for a while after boiling, they will form high amounts of resistant starch, a fiber-like substance that has been shown to have various health benefits, including weight loss .
                            Sweet potatoes, turnips and other root vegetables are also excellent.
                            <p><b>SUMMARY  &nbsp</b>Boiled potatoes are among the most filling foods. They’re particularly good at reducing your appetite, potentially suppressing your food intake later in the day. </p>
                            <p><b>7. Tuna</b></p>
                            Tuna is another low-calorie, high-protein food.
                            It’s lean fish, meaning it’s low in fat.
                            Tuna is popular among bodybuilders and fitness models who’re on a cut, as it's a great way to increase protein intake while keeping total calories and fat low.
                            If you're trying to emphasize protein intake, make sure to choose tuna canned in water, not oil.
                            <p><b>SUMMARY</b>Tuna is an excellent, lean source of high-quality protein. Replacing other macronutrients, such as carbs or fat, with protein is an effective weight loss strategy on a calorie-restricted diet. </p>
                            <p><b>8. Beans and Legumes</b></p>
                            Some beans and other legumes can be beneficial for weight loss.
                            This includes lentils, black beans, kidney beans and some others.
                            These foods tend to be high in protein and fiber, which are two nutrients that have been shown to lead to satiety.
                            They also tend to contain some resistant starch.
                            The main problem is that a lot of people have difficulties tolerating legumes. For this reason, it’s important to prepare them properly.
                            <p><b>SUMMARY &nbsp</b>Beans and legumes are a good addition to your weight loss diet. They’re both high in protein and fiber, contributing to feelings of fullness and a lower calorie intake. </p>
                            <p><b>9. Soups</b></p>
                            As mentioned above, meals and diets with a low energy density tend to make people eat fewer calories.
                            Most foods with a low energy density are those that contain lots of water, such as vegetables and fruits.
                            But you can also just add water to your food, making a soup.
                            Some studies have shown that eating the exact same food turned into a soup rather than as solid food, makes people feel more satiated and eat significantly fewer calories .
                            Just make sure not to add too much fat to your soup, such as cream or coconut milk, as this can significantly increase its calorie content.
                            <p><b>SUMMARY </b> can be an effective part of a weight loss diet. Their high water content makes them very filling. However, try to avoid creamy or oily soups. </p>
                            <p><b>10. Avocados</b></p>
                            Avocados are a unique fruit.
                            While most fruits are high in carbs, avocados are loaded with healthy fats.
                            They’re particularly high in monounsaturated oleic acid, the same type of fat found in olive oil.
                            Despite being mostly fat, avocados also contain a lot of water and fiber, making them less energy-dense than you may think.
                            What’s more, they’re a perfect addition to vegetable salads, as studies show that their fat content can increase carotenoid antioxidant absorption from the vegetables 2.6- to 15-fold.
                            They also contain many important nutrients, including fiber and potassium.
                            <p><b>SUMMARY &nbsp</b> Avocados are a good example of a healthy fat source you can include in your diet while trying to lose weight. Just make sure to keep your intake moderate.

                        <p>There’s just something about an egg burger. The runny yolk and savory taste of beef together feel about as rich and decadent and satisfying as it gets. Add avocado with the typical burger fixings, and you’re looking at the king of keto burgers.
                            This might not become your everyday burger, but we’d call it one of those must-have burger experiences. The fresh tastes, the creamy textures, the sheer audacity of it—few burgers inspire the way this one does. </p>

                        <h2>12 Intermittent Fasting Tips for Athletes</h2>
                    </div>
                    <div class="blog-box">
                        <img src="images/article3.jpg">
                        <p>Yesterday, I explained the potential benefits and drawbacks of intermittent fasting for athletes. Maybe yesterday’s post intrigued you. Maybe you’re curious about this whole intermittent fasting thing but don’t want to sacrifice your performance in the gym or on the field.
                            What are my specific recommendations for athletes who wish to explore intermittent fasting? I’ve got twelve…plus some details about my own fasting and workout routine. </p>
                            <ul>
                            <p>1) Use Restricted Eating Windows Over All-day Fasts</p>
                            Athletes who want to lean out or maintain strength and performance while lowering body weight might have more success with shortened eating windows than with all day fasts or “one meal a day.” Fast for 12-16 hours, train, and break the fast. Then have 8-12 hours to eat. This will give you a nice block of almost pure fat-burning with enough of an eating window to get the calories you need to grow and maintain muscle and to recover from your training.
                            <p>2) Small Amount Of Protein Pre-workout May Help</p>
                            <p> Having a small bit of protein (20 grams whey or maybe 10 grams BCAAs) can help if truly fasted workouts are too hard. </p>
                            <p>3) Fasted Walks In the Mornings
                            Whether you skip breakfast or dinner, you’ll have a block of time in the mornings before eating anything. That’s when fat-burning will be upregulated, and brisk fasted walking is a nice way to enhance it. </p>
                            <p>4) Light Cardio After a Fasted Lifting Session
                            A heavy lifting session will get free fatty acids liberated from your adipose tissue, particularly if you’re fasted. Doing some very light cardio after your weights should in theory help you utilize all that mobilized adipose tissue. Go for a 20-minute walk, do ten minutes on the bike, or something similar. </p>
                            <p>5) “Train Fasted, Race Fed”
                            This is a more intense version of “train low-carb, race high-carb,” a popular and well-researched method of enhancing fat adaptation and increasing fuel efficiency in endurance athletes. Training in a fasted state “forces” the athlete to burn stored fat because, well, there isn’t a whole lot of carbohydrate available. Plus, fasting necessarily increases the circulation of free fatty acids, which can be burned for fuel. This applies to everyone, not just people “racing.” The trick is to train in a fasted state (if you find it helps) and compete (whether it’s CrossFit games, a basketball game, a lifting competition, etc.) in a fed state—as long as it seems to improve your performance. </p>
                            <p>6) Most Of the Time, Break the Fast Shortly After the Workout
                            If you’re skipping dinner and eating breakfast, try morning workouts. If you’re skipping breakfast and eating lunch, try afternoon workouts. </p>
                            <p>7) Every So Often, Continue the Fast After a Workout
                            This enhances secretion of growth hormone, which fasting already elevates. Don’t make this an every-workout habit, though. Diminishing returns and all. </p>
                            <p>8) Every Athlete Can Probably Benefit From the Occasional Longer Fast (24 hours+)
                            This will normalize inflammation, boost growth hormone, and upregulate autophagy, giving you all the necessary co-factors for rest and recovery. Tissues will heal, joints will recover. Do nothing more on these days than easy movement (walks, hikes, bike rides, swims). Time this fast away from competition because your performance may suffer. Do these once a week or every other week. </p>
                            <p>9) If You Have Joint Problems (or Want To Avoid Them), Take Collagen or Drink Bone Broth Before a Fasted Workout
                            Fifteen grams of pre-workout collagen or gelatin with a few hundred milligrams of vitamin C has been shown to improve collagen synthesis in connective tissue, and collagen shouldn’t disrupt the fast too much. </p>
                            <p>10) More Isn’t Better
                            I see this a lot, especially with endurance athletes who get into intermittent fasting. They start eating breakfast later and see their times drop and their body fat disappear. They feel lighter on their feet, faster, just better all around. So they push breakfast even later and maintain the benefits, even building on them. Pretty soon they’re skipping lunch, and their performance drops off a cliff. When trying to use fasting to improve athletic performance, less is more generally speaking. </p>
                            <p>11) Realize That Exercise and Fasting Are Additive
                            For the average couch potato to get the benefits of fasting, he or she might need to go 16 hours without food. The couch potato isn’t liberating body fat through training. The couch potato isn’t getting into ketosis through physical activity. The couch potato isn’t increasing mitochondrial density—the power plants of the cells which actually process fuel—with exercise. The athlete is doing all those things. For the athlete, many of the benefits of fasting will appear with smaller fasting windows. </p>
                            <p>Consider Sleeping Low</p> 
                            <p>“Sleeping low” is an alternative to full-on fasting that actually seems to work well. This is how you do it: </p>
                            <ul>
                            <li>	Afternoon workout. This should be something intense that depletes glycogen—sprinting, metabolic conditioning, high volume strength training, high intensity endurance workouts. </li>
                            <li> Eat protein and fat at dinner, no carbs. You’re not refilling your glycogen. You’re revelingin your lack of glycogen. </li>
                            <li> Sleep. </li>
                            <li>	Wake up and do low-intensity cardio (walking, cycling, hiking, swimming) before breakfast. Eat carbs at breakfast.</li>
                            <li> Repeat. </li>
                        </ul>
                            When a group of triathletes followed this protocol, both their submaximal efficiency and supramaximal capacity. High submaximal efficiency means you get more power out of each stroke/pedal/step with less energy required. Your “easy pace” becomes faster and more powerful. High supramaximal capacity means you can last longer at your maximum power output.
                            It’s likely that full-on fasting could be integrated into this protocol. Maybe with a compressed eating window leading up to the afternoon workout.

                        <p>Preheat the grill to medium-high. In a large bowl, toss shrimp in oil and season with salt and pepper. Grill the shrimp for 1 to 2 minutes on each side or until just cooked through. Be careful not to overcook the shrimp, or they will be tough and rubbery. Remove from the grill.
                            Place about 3 shrimp in each lettuce leaf. Drizzle with the Serrano-Mint Sauce and with a little chili oil, if desired. Sprinkle with a few cilantro leaves. Roll up the lettuce leaves, and eat immediately.
                            Place all ingredients, except for salt, in a blender. Pulse until smooth. Season, to taste.</p>
